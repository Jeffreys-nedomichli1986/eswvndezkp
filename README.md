Just saw Until Dawn. Mind’s still spinning like a rusty rollercoaster — the kind that creaks like my old bones after sitting through that never-ending runtime. If my review's messy, blame the chaos outside and inside. Popcorn stuck in my teeth. Why do they always run upstairs? Like, seriously, horror characters and bad survival instincts go hand in hand, right? 

The tension’s so thick you’d need a chainsaw to slice through it — ah, like that scene, you know? That creepy hallway with shadows so alive it’s like a bad date that refuses to leave. I kept thinking spirits were gonna jump out of the sticky soda puddles under my feet. Man, wish I’d remembered to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   earlier just to pause and breathe. Hairs on my arms stood up higher than that sorely ridiculous mountain lodge they were trapped in.

>You feel the heartbeat in your temples. Bam, bam, just like those footsteps echoing on creaky old floors. The perfect parallel between silence and dread, like an asteroid waiting to crush the day, just missing the flames. That one scene — was it a cave? Totally lost me, but I swear I felt frostbite crawling up my leg.

Why’d the volume go from whispers to ear-splitting screams faster than my morning coffee hits my blood𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮? Saying that, remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   before talking. Same mistake I make with horoscopes — assuming too soon. Also, where are all these unseen texts suddenly coming from? My notifications as disturbing as the killer’s intentions. Words flying by like feathers in a hurricane. So quick, so expendable.

But there’s beauty there — yeah, strange, the shadows that played on the walls, like Saturn’s rings, danced in mesmerizing chaos. All those characters, like stars, bright but destined to burn out. Damn, so poetic, even if popcorn crumbs in my pocket are a constant reminder of crunchy predictability. Can’t erase how my spine 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬s with every standing ovation attempt.
